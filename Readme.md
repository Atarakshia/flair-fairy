# Reddit Flair Fairy

## What is the Flair Fairy?

The Flair Fairy is a reddit bot I made for [/r/badcode](http://www.reddit.com/r/badcode) that adds flair
to user's posts listing what language their posted code snippet uses.

## What license is it released under?

It is released under the [Unlicense](http://www.unlicense.org). In other words
do what you like, doesn't matter to me.

## Can I help?

Super yes, if you want to add more features to it, fork and send a pull request.
I'd be very appreciative.

### What dependencies do I need?

easy_install [reddit](https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api) and
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) then you're
all set to go! Was written to work with most versions of python, let me know
if you have trouble though.
